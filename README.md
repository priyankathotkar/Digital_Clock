 
⏰ Digital Clock  Project ⏰

Welcome to my *Digital Clock* project! 🎉 This is a simple and sleek clock that I created to practice my front-end web development skills. It dynamically updates to match your system's current time, ensuring precision every second! 🕒


🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML 📝
- CSS 🎨
- JavaScript 💻


✨ Features

- 🕐 Real-time Display: The clock updates every second to match your system's time.
- 💻 Responsive Design: Adjusts beautifully across devices.
- 🔥 Minimalist Style: Clean and simple design that focuses on the essentials.



 🛠️ How It Works

Using JavaScript's `Date` object, the system time is fetched and displayed in real-time. The clock updates every second thanks to the `updateClock()` function. All the styling magic happens with CSS, while **HTML** provides the structure for displaying the time.
